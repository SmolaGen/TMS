# Customer Notification System

Automated notifications to customers for key order events: order confirmed, driver assigned, driver en-route, approaching delivery, delivered. Support Telegram and webhook channels.

## Rationale
Eliminates manual phone/SMS communication pain point (pain-4-3). Proactive notifications reduce 'where is my order' calls and improve customer satisfaction.

## User Stories
- As a customer, I want to receive updates about my delivery so that I don't need to call for status
- As a dispatcher, I want automatic notifications so that I spend less time on status calls

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic notification on order status changes
- [ ] Configurable notification preferences per order or customer
- [ ] Support for Telegram messaging to customers
- [ ] Webhook notifications for custom integrations
- [ ] ETA updates when driver is approaching
