=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: 001-add-react-query-error-boundaries-for-api-failure-r
Workspace: managed by orchestrator
Started: 2026-01-21T10:30:00Z

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a feature enhancement to improve user experience and application robustness by implementing centralized error handling for API failures using React Query and Error Boundaries.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created project_index.json
- Created context.json
- Phases: 3
- Total subtasks: 6
- Created init.sh

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Create Reusable Error Boundary Component): 2 subtasks, depends on []
- Phase 2 (Integrate Error Boundaries with React Query): 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-error-boundary-component]
- Phase 3 (Refine API Error Handling for Display): 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-error-boundary-component]

Services Involved:
- frontend: UI components and API interaction layer

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups: [Phase 2, Phase 3]
- Parallel group reason: Both phases depend on phase-1 but can be worked on independently and affect different parts of the frontend codebase.
