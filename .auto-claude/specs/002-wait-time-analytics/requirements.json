  "task_description": "# Wait Time Analytics\n\nCalculate and display average wait times for orders, including pickup wait times and delivery wait times. Track and analyze wait time patterns for operational improvement.\n\n## Rationale\nCompletes TODO placeholder in stats endpoint. Wait time data is critical for operational efficiency measurement - a key success metric. Manual systems cannot track this (pain-4-5).\n\n## User Stories\n- As a fleet manager, I want to track average dispatch time so that I can measure team efficiency\n- As a dispatcher, I want to see current wait times so that I can prioritize unassigned orders\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Wait time is calculated from order creation to driver assignment\n- [ ] Stats endpoint returns actual wait time averages\n- [ ] Wait time can be filtered by time period (today, week, month)\n- [ ] Historical wait time trends are available for analysis\n",
