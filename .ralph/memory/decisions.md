### 2023-10-27 - Task: Реализовать сессии пользователей

The existing `src/main.py` already uses `Flask-Login` which provides comprehensive user session management out-of-the-box. This includes session creation, storage (via Flask's signed cookies), and validation. The `SECRET_KEY` is configured, ensuring session security. Therefore, the task is considered complete as the functionality is already present.
